# NoveltyOddball_fMRI

This reposortiry includes scripts for a Novelty Oddball experiment with fMRI. The subjects are presented with three different types of stimuli - standard, target, and oddball. They are instructed on how to react to standards and targets, but they do not have any instructions abotu the oddball. However, given the instructions 'When and only when you see target, press the left button', they should react to the oddballs in the same way they do to the standards. Using this differentiation, we can distinguish false and correct responses to oddball. 

Additionally, we are fitting a decay function to the oddball responses, quantifying the amount of surprise they elicit on the trial-to-trial basis. The assumption behind this is that the earlier oddball trials are more surprising thna hte later ones.
